An Add-on for Mozilla Firefox

Save back a file URI scheme document, but save from DOM, which means it would
save changes effected by JavaScript.

Made to allow Gecko (in Firefox) to be a JavaScript engine helper application,
helping out other (source) editors that cannot run JavaScript themselves.
